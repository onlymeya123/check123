/**
 * Centralized user-facing copy.
 *
 * Single source of truth for blocking/guiding/warning strings. Pure constants
 * and template functions — no React, no JSX. Importing this file is the only
 * way to put a string in front of the user for any validation, warning, or
 * informational moment.
 *
 * Why this exists: with UX now driven by copy (Round 9), inconsistent wording
 * erodes trust. The same concept ("trip too long") used to be phrased three
 * different ways across the codebase. One file = one tone review.
 *
 * Future i18n: this file becomes the literal swap point. Add a `lang` arg to
 * each template, or wrap with an i18n lib — no callers need to change.
