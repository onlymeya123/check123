# Pavey — AI-Powered Travel Planning App

## Overview

Wandr is a mobile-first travel planning application built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. It enables users to plan, navigate, and budget multi-destination trips through an AI-assisted or fully manual workflow. The app adapts to the user's travel style ("vibe"), filters places by budget, and provides turn-by-turn itinerary navigation with a real-time wallet tracker.

**Core value proposition:** Plan a full day of travel in seconds — or build it stop by stop — then navigate and track spending, all in one app.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 19 + TypeScript |
| Build | Vite |
| Styling | TailwindCSS (custom design tokens) |
| Animation | Framer Motion 12 |
| Routing | React Router v6 |

## Design System

**Colors**
- `brand-*` — Primary blue (`#3B5BFF` = brand-500)
- `ink-*` — Neutrals (ink-900 = near-black, ink-50 = near-white)
- `amber-*` — Highlights and warnings
- `emerald-*` — Success states

**No color gradients.** All backgrounds are solid. Image overlays (photo darkening) and scroll-fade helpers are the only uses of opacity transitions.

**Typography**
- Display headings: `font-display` (bold, tight tracking)
- Body: system sans-serif
- Minimum readable size: 11px (labels), 13px (body)

**Interaction**
- `press` class: `active:scale-95` tap feedback on all interactive elements
- `shadow-glow`: brand-colored glow on primary CTAs
- `no-scrollbar`: hidden scrollbars on all scroll containers

**Auth Guard:** `AppShell` reads `onboardingComplete` from context. If false, all routes redirect to `/onboarding`. Onboarding is always accessible regardless of auth state.

**BottomNav tabs:** Home · Map · [Buddy FAB center] · Wallet · Profile

## Page-by-Page Documentation

---

### 1. OnboardingPage (`/onboarding`)

**Purpose:** New user setup. Collects auth credentials and trip preferences, then calls `completeOnboarding()` to set up the full app state.

**Skip condition:** If `onboardingComplete` is already true when the page mounts, the user is immediately redirected to `/` (handles back-navigation and already-authenticated users).

**Step Flow:**
```
welcome → auth_form → vibe → destinations → dates → budget → interests → location → /
```

**Progress bar** shown on steps: vibe (1/6) → destinations (2/6) → dates (3/6) → budget (4/6) → interests (5/6) → location (6/6)

**Layout structure:**
```
flex column (full height)
├── Progress bar + back button (shrink-0, always visible)
├── Scrollable content area (flex-1, overflow-y-auto)
│   └── Step title + step-specific UI
└── CTA button footer (shrink-0, always visible, never clipped)
```

The CTA is **outside** the scroll container — it is always visible regardless of content height, screen size, or keyboard state.

---

#### Step: `welcome`

**Design:** Solid brand-blue (`bg-brand-500`) full-screen background. White logo card (✈️ on white rounded square). Bottom white sheet slides up with two CTAs.

**Actions:**
- "Get Started — it's free" → sets `authMode = 'signup'`, goes to `auth_form`
- "I already have an account" → sets `authMode = 'login'`, goes to `auth_form`

---

#### Step: `auth_form`

**Design:** White background. Back arrow returns to `welcome`. Scrollable form fields. CTA pinned at bottom.

**Sign Up fields:** Full Name, Email, Password (show/hide toggle), Confirm Password
**Login fields:** Email, Password

**Validation:**
- Email: required, valid format
- Password: required, minimum 6 characters
- Name (signup only): required
- Confirm Password (signup only): must match password

**On submit:** 1.2s simulated auth loading spinner, then advances to `vibe`.

**Toggle:** "Already have an account? Sign in" / "Don't have an account? Sign up" switches mode without losing entered data.

---

#### Step: `vibe`

**Design:** 2×2 grid of vibe cards.

**Options:**
- 🌴 Chill — "Relaxed beaches & slow mornings"
- 🔥 Chaos — "Full days & hidden street food"
- 🧘 Zen — "Temples, nature & mindful walks"
- 💎 Luxury — "Boutique stays & fine dining"

Active card shows brand-500 border + background + checkmark badge. Default: Zen.

**Continue** → `destinations`

---

#### Step: `destinations`

**Design:** Text input + Add button. Added destinations appear as a reorderable list.

**Quick suggestions** shown when list is empty: Paris, Rome, Bali, Tokyo, Barcelona (tap to add instantly).

**Destination list features:**
- Numbered badges (1, 2, 3…)
- Up/Down reorder arrows (disabled at boundaries)
- Grip icon (visual affordance)
- X remove button
- Multi-city divider banner when 2+ destinations added

**If Continue pressed with empty list:** auto-adds "My Destination" as placeholder.

**Continue** → `dates`

---

#### Step: `dates`

**Design:** Date range picker with a compact inline calendar.

**Two-phase selection:**
- Phase 1 (DEPART): tap a start date → automatically moves to phase 2
- Phase 2 (RETURN): tap an end date (must be ≥ start date)

**Date display chips** at top show selected dates. When both selected, a "DAYS" chip shows total trip duration.

**Reset dates** link clears both dates and returns to phase 1.

**Past dates** are disabled (grayed out, `cursor-default`).

**Continue label:** "Continue" if both dates selected, "Skip for now" if not.

**Continue** → `budget` (duration step removed — days are calculated from date range automatically)

---

#### Step: `budget`

**Design:** Large budget display + range slider + preset buttons.

**Range:** Rp 50K → Rp 1jt+ (IDR, 50,000 to 1,000,000 in 10,000 steps)
**Default:** Rp 500,000
**Presets:** Rp 150K / Rp 300K / Rp 600K
**Info note:** "Budget covers entry fees, food, and activities. Transport is extra."

**Continue** → `interests`

---

#### Step: `interests`

**Design:** Chip grid of 12 interest options. Optional step.

**Options:** Coffee ☕, Beaches 🏖️, History 🏛️, Art 🎨, Street Food 🍜, Shopping 🛍️, Hiking 🥾, Photography 📷, Nightlife 🌃, Wellness 🧖, Architecture 🏙️, Local Markets 🏪

Multi-select. Active chips show brand-500 fill + checkmark.

**Continue** → `location`
**Skip** → `location` (skips without selecting anything)

---

#### Step: `location`

**Design:** Explanation card + allow/skip actions.

**Benefits listed:**
- 📍 Nearby discovery — find hidden gems within walking distance
- 🧭 Turn-by-turn navigation — live directions between stops
- 🔔 Smart alerts — know when you're close to your next stop

**"Allow Location Access"** button: simulates permission flow (800ms), shows success state with green checkmark when granted.

**"Skip for now"** shows location-denied warning but allows continuing.

**CTA when granted:** "Start exploring →" (emerald green)
**CTA when not granted:** "Continue without location"

**On Continue:** calls `completeOnboarding(data)` which:
1. Sets `authUser`, `isAuthenticated`, `onboardingComplete`
2. Sets `vibe` and `budget`
3. Creates `destinations[]` from entered destinations + date-derived day counts
4. Creates a wallet `Trip` with full budget (budget × totalDays)
5. Sets `journeyStart` with start date and total days
6. Clears `itinerary` (user generates from Home)
7. Navigates to `/`

---

### 2. HomePage (`/`)

**Purpose:** Central dashboard. Shows current itinerary, search, vibe/budget controls, and CTAs to generate a plan.

**Layout:** Full-height scroll. Hero image at top, overlapping glass card, then content sections.

**Top section:**

---

#### Section: Multi-Destination Route Strip

Shown only when `destinations.length > 1`.

Horizontal scrollable pill row with destination names and day counts. Active destination highlighted in brand-500. Arrow separators between stops.

"Add stop +" button opens Add Destination sheet.

Tapping a destination pill calls `setActiveDestIdx(i)` to switch context.

---

#### Section: Search + Filter

Full-width search input with filter button.

**Search behavior:** Real-time filtering of `PLACES[]` by name, category, and tags. Results appear as dropdown list (max 5). Tapping a result opens the Place Detail sheet.

**Filter sheet:** Opens on filter button tap. Filters: Category (multi-select chips) and Minimum Rating (0, 4.0, 4.3, 4.5, 4.7). Active filter count shown on button badge.

---

#### Section: TODAY'S PLAN

**Case A — Plan exists (`itinerary.length > 0`):**
- If navigating: "Navigation active" banner → taps to `/navigate`
- Vertical timeline of stops with time estimates and distance gaps
- Each stop: tap opens Place Detail sheet, bookmark button toggles saved
- **Edit Plan** and **View Map** buttons below timeline (outside timeline container, so the vertical line doesn't bleed into buttons)
- Edit Plan → `/generate?edit=1` (opens GeneratePage in edit mode, no rebuild)
- View Map → `/map`

**Case B — No plan:**
- Empty state card with 🗺️ and contextual message
- 2×2 action grid: AI Generate, Plan Manually, Explore Nearby, Saved Places

Shown when single-destination trip and user is onboarded. Dashed border "Add another destination" button.

---

#### Section: Vibe Picker

4-column grid matching onboarding vibes. Selecting updates `vibe` in context, which affects `buildItinerary()` output.

---

#### Section: Budget Slider

Range slider (Rp 50K–1M). Updates `budget` in context. Values shown at endpoints and as current value label.

---

#### Section: Generate CTAs

Two cards side by side:
- **AI Generate** (brand-500) → `/generate`
- **Plan Manually** (outlined) → `/generate?mode=manual`

---

#### Section: Saved Places

Shown only when `savedPlaces.length > 0`. Horizontal scroll of place cards with remove (×) button. Tapping opens Place Detail sheet.

---

#### Section: Import from Social

TikTok / Instagram link parser. Paste a URL, hit Parse → 1.8s simulation → shows detected place card with name, image, description, cost, platform badge.

Actions: "Add to Map" (navigates to `/map`) or "Add to Itinerary" (adds to context).

---

#### Add Destination Sheet (modal)

City/country input + day count stepper. "Add to Trip" button calls `addDestination()`.

---

### 3. GeneratePage (`/generate`)

**Purpose:** Build or edit an itinerary — either AI-generated or manually.

**Entry points:**
- `/generate` — AI mode (loading → reveal)
- `/generate?mode=manual` — Manual mode (instant reveal, plan + search UI)
- `/generate?edit=1` — Edit mode (skips rebuild, shows existing itinerary)

**URL params:**
- `mode=manual` → `isManualMode = true`
- `edit=1` → `isEditMode = true`

**Phase logic:**
```
isManualMode || isEditMode  → phase = 'reveal' (skip loading)
AI mode                     → phase = 'loading' → 'reveal' (after 2.3s)
```

**On mount:**
```
if (!isManualMode && !isEditMode) setItinerary(buildItinerary())
```
Edit mode preserves existing itinerary without rebuilding.

---

#### AI Mode — Loading Phase

Full-screen loading skeleton (1.2s delay) → 2.3s total → transitions to reveal phase. Shows shimmer placeholders for stop cards.

---

#### AI Mode — Reveal Phase

**Stop list** (top): Numbered cards with image, name, category, rating, time, price. Each card has:
- Drag handle (reorder)
- × remove button (4s undo toast)
- Cultural intelligence row (collapsible) — shows local tips, etiquette, language phrases

**Undo system:** Removed stops show "Undo" toast for 4 seconds. Tapping restores the stop in its original position.

**Alternatives section** (bottom): "Try instead" recommendations — 2-column grid of places not in current plan. Tap to add.

**"Add More Stops" button** → opens AlternativesSheet.

**AlternativesSheet (modal):**
- Search input (filters all PLACES by name/category, excludes already-added stops)
- X clear button on search
- Results list with add buttons
- "Add custom place" at bottom

**Confirm Plan** → navigates to `/transition` (TransitionPage loading screen) then `/map`

---

#### Manual Mode — Layout

```

2. ADD MORE STOPS divider
3. Search input (primary interaction)
4. Filtered results (excluding already-added stops)

**"Next stop":** increments `navIndex`, resets `progress` to 0, resets `arrived`, shows toast "Heading to [next stop name]".

**"Finish trip":** calls `setIsNavigating(false)`, `completeTrip()`, navigates to `/profile` after 600ms.

---

#### Cancel Navigation Modal

Confirmation sheet:
- 🛑 "Cancel navigation?"
- Progress summary: "You've visited X of Y stops. Progress will be saved."
- "Keep Going" | "Cancel Trip"

Red-tinted row button → shows confirmation bottom sheet.

**Logout confirmation:**
- 🚪 "Log out?" with message "You'll be taken back to the welcome screen."
- Cancel / Log Out buttons
- "Log Out" calls `logout()` + `nav('/onboarding', { replace: true })`

`logout()` clears: `isAuthenticated`, `authUser`, `onboardingComplete`, `itinerary`, `visited`, `savedPlaces`, `isNavigating`, `navIndex`.

## State Handling

### Empty States

| Scenario | UI |
|---|---|
| No itinerary on Home | 🗺️ card + AI Generate / Plan Manually / Explore / Saved action grid |
| No itinerary on Map (map view) | Animated bottom card with "Plan [Destination]" CTA |
| No itinerary on Map (list view) | Centered empty state with same CTA |
| No transactions in Wallet | 💸 "No expenses yet" card with helper text |
| New user on Profile | Welcome banner + locked badges + zero stats |
| No current stop in Navigate | ⚠️ fallback screen with "Back to Map" |

### Loading States

| Scenario | UI |
|---|---|
| AI itinerary generation | 1.2s delay → shimmer skeleton cards → reveal with animation |
| Auth form submission | Rotating Sparkles spinner on button for 1.2s |
| Social link parsing | Sparkles spinner + shimmer bar for 1.8s |
| Receipt scanning | Animated scan line for 2.2s |
| TransitionPage | 2.8s animated 3-step progress then auto-navigate |

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| User navigates to `/onboarding` when already authed | Redirected to `/` on mount |
| GeneratePage opened with `?edit=1` | No itinerary rebuild, loads in `reveal` phase |
| Stop removed during navigation | `visited` set and `navIndex` unaffected; stop removed from `itinerary` |
| Trip deletion when only 1 trip exists | `deleteTrip` no-ops |
| Wallet Add Expense when `isNavigating = true` | Button hidden; locked banner shown |
| Wallet all actions when `tripCompleted = true` | Add Expense hidden, Split/Scan disabled, read-only banner |
| Back navigation during onboarding | `back()` follows `FLOW` array order; never goes to removed `duration` step |

---

## Key Entry Points Summary

| Action | Entry Point | Route |
|---|---|---|
| Start AI plan | Home "AI Generate" card | `/generate` |
| Start manual plan | Home "Plan Manually" card | `/generate?mode=manual` |
| Edit existing plan | Home "Edit Plan" button | `/generate?edit=1` |
| Remove a stop | Map bottom sheet × button | inline |
| Remove a stop | Map list view × button | inline |
| Start navigation | Map "Start Navigation" button | `/navigate` |
| Return to navigation | Persistent nav bar (any page) | `/navigate` |
| Add a destination | Home route strip "+" | Add Destination sheet |
| Add a stop | GeneratePage "Add More Stops" | AlternativesSheet |
| Log out | Profile → Log Out | `/onboarding` |
| Track expense | Wallet "Add Expense" | AddExpenseSheet |
| Split a bill | Wallet "Split Bill" | SplitBillSheet |
| Create new wallet trip | Wallet "New Trip +" | NewTripSheet |

## Flows That Were Removed / Changed

| Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|---|---|
| "Trip Duration" onboarding step existed | Removed entirely; duration derived from date range |
| Onboarding used `position: fixed` CTA button | CTA is `shrink-0` flex footer, always visible |
| Phone frame clipped fixed-position elements on desktop | PhoneFrame is now a fluid full-height wrapper |
| OnboardingPage accessible even when logged in | Redirects to `/` on mount if `onboardingComplete = true` |
| MapPage header had "Edit" button → `/generate?edit=1` | Edit button removed; inline × on cards |
| Timeline vertical line bled into Edit Plan button | Buttons moved outside timeline `relative` container |
| Purple gradient backgrounds throughout app | All color gradients replaced with solid brand/ink colors |
| Welcome screen: blue→purple gradient | Solid `bg-brand-500` blue |
| TransitionPage: purple gradient | `bg-white` with brand-blue icon |
| Gradient in persona progress, badges, banners | Solid colors throughout |
